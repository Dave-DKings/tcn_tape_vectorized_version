## 🎯 Purpose

These scripts were created to:
1. Diagnose specific bugs and issues
2. Verify that fixes were correctly applied
3. Test edge cases and corner scenarios
4. Validate data transformations

---

## 📝 Usage

Most of these scripts are **one-time diagnostics** that have already served their purpose. They are kept for:
- Historical reference
- Re-verification if needed
- Understanding the debugging process

To run any diagnostic:
```bash
cd C:\Users\Owner\adaptive_portfolio_rl_vectorized
python tests/diagnostics/<script_name>.py
```

## ⚠️ Note

These scripts may depend on specific data states or configurations that existed when they were created. They might need updates to work with the current codebase.

For **current validation**, use the scripts in the root directory:
- `verify_fixes.py` - Comprehensive fix verification
- `diagnostic_scaling_audit.py` - Data scaling audit
- `test_reproducibility.py` - Reproducibility testing
