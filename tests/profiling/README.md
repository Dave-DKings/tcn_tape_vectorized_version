## 🎯 Usage

Profiling scripts are used to:
1. Measure execution time of specific operations
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Compare different implementations
4. Monitor memory consumption
5. Validate optimization improvements

To run profiling:
```bash
cd C:\Users\Owner\adaptive_portfolio_rl_vectorized
python tests/profiling/profile_tcn_detail.py
```

## 📊 Output

Profiling scripts typically provide:
- Execution time measurements
- Memory usage statistics
- Line-by-line performance data
- Comparison tables
- Bottleneck identification
